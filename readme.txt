Project 2: Sort Algorithm Race
Team name: Stan
Team members: Stanley Shi

------------------------------------------------------------

Intro

  This program draws graphics that compares the speed of 4 different 
  sort algorithms: insertion sort, Gold's poresort, mergesort, and quicksort.

Zip Contents

  File readme.txt;  This file.

  File sort_race.html;  Open this file with a web browser
    to run the program.

  File p5.js;  This is the P5 package. It is loaded inside the html.

  File sketch.js;  This contains several P5 user-defined linkage functions
    (setup, draw). P5's setup() is run once before page display.
    P5's draw() is run once per display frame, allowing you to do animation.

  File complexity_order.pdf;  This document provides a Big-O anaylsis 
    of the program.

  File assets/styles.css;  This is an extra-small example of controlling
    webpage styling.  // Loaded inside the html.

  File assets/draw-stuff.js;  This is an example to show loading a JS
    script file from a folder other than the index HTML file's
    folder location.  It also includes the utility draw_grid function
    written in P5+JS. // Loaded inside the html.

External Requirements

  None

Setup and Installaltion 

  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder.

  2. Open the HTML file, cell-ant-example.html, with a web browser.
     The example P5 program should start immediately.

Features

  o- This example draws a grid and simulates the amount of passes it takes
     for 4 different sorting algorithms to complete.

Known Bugs

  o- Quicksort algorithm remains incomplete
